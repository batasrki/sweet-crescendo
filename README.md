# sweet-crescendo Description

This is a web-based music lesson tool. The intention here is for the
music teacher to upload a piece of music that can be used as a guide
for the student. The student will perform the music piece while being
recorded by our tool. Upon finishing, the tool will upload the
student's recording, run an automated comparison and subsequently
grade the student.
